      <p> Em biet toc em xinh keke em yeu anh. Almost 6 months with you, I'm so happy to have you in my life, and I'm also happy
        to been through your 18s with you, at US. I hope you will have a great 19s birthday, and I hope you will have a gorgeous year ahead
        full of internship offers (lol), and full of cutie silly pieces of memory with your gf. 
        This birthday gift is just a really small part of whatever we have been through, and will have been through.
